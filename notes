evolution experiments:

- organisms move "into" each other and can pass through each other. collisions happen when cells are shared by multiple organisms.
	- grid structure: (n rows) x  (m columns) x (1 hashmap of cells)
	- hashmap needed for organisms to move them when they move (access with organism ID)
- food
	- functions to keep organism alive, each food type contributes a certain amount to daily food requirement
	- adding food producer type cells on organisms(type must match for eater and producer)
	- cant eat own produced food
	- food storing cells (also below)
- organism cell types
	- wall breaking, wall creation
	- cell moving (moves non-organism cells in direction cell is moving) (maybe food hoarding?)
	- food storing
	- reproduction (reproduces if touched with other reproduction cell at custom birth rate)
		- spacing needed for reproduction as another experiment
	- non functional (for body shape experiments)
		- only can add cells to empty sides of these
	- add movement pattern neural nets from other video you saw
	- use mover cells as possible pivot points
	- multiple eyes
	- armor only lasting x collisions before disappearing (with recharge)
	- cell types that block organisms from moving through them
- eyes dont see if blocked by own organism
- eyes take more damage (maybe leading to eye armoring)
- eye input to the neural net for movement
- look into evolvable mutation rate (already in dev)
- position of cells relative to center cell as input to neural net (positioning body relative to other cells)
- generation (or time units) skipping input
- separation with walls every so often to separate populations programatically
- speed as neural net param (but increases food need or decreases damage needed or something)

- movement todo
	- create random "genome" strings for starting organisms
	- neural net
		- sensory input neurons (0.0-1.0)
		- action output neurons (output = probability of firing)
		- internal neurons
	- connection weights range -4.0 to 4.0
	- neuron computes tanh(sum of connections*weights)
	- remove internal neurons when no connection to action outputs (useless connections)

- todo food functions
	- cant eat own produced food
	- move to energy model
		- energy count in organism anatomy
		- can only move if has mover and energy is above 0
		- cells have unique energy used per tick (more complex cells = more usage)
			- indirectly leads to size bad
		- 

- todo collisions
	- get rid of "empty cell" concept
	- implement hashmaps per grid cell
	- find out whats up with "cell size"
	- add organism ID for hashmap key?

dev notes:
- WorldEnvironment
	- starts simulation by creating first organism
	- removes dead organisms
	- handles food spawning
	- ticks clock
- EnvironmentController
	- handles mouse actions on environment
- GridMap
	- data structure for cells
- Organism
	- Cell
		- CellState is cell types
